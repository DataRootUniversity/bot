# Hello and welcome to the new DRU tutorial!

## In this tutorial, we summarize the changes to the functionality of an upgraded bot and roadmap content. 

The new functionality of the bot and extended materials aim to improve the studying experience at DRU. We split the roadmap into **several parts** dedicated to different sections of **Machine Learning**, making the learning process **consistent** and **convenient**.

So, the full **DRU ML specialization** will include:
 - **Data Science Fundamentals course**
 - **Practical Data Science with PyTorch**
 - **Production Deep Learning with Tensorflow 2.0**
 
Our **smart bot** will guide you through each module and tell you want to do, when and how.
Now let's get started with overview of the **beta-version** of the **DRU-bot**. 
 
 
To see all available programs you need to use command `/dru-programs`. 

**`Hint`**: It's better to use commands in the chat with **DRU-bot**. Simply go to the chat and send the text of the command as a plain message.

 <div align="center">
 <img align="center" width="706" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/dru-programs-in.png?raw=true">
 </div>
 <br>
 
After sending the command `/dru-programs` you will see the list of all **DRU programs** and their **descriptions**:

 <div align="center">
 <img align="center" width="450" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/dru-programs-out.png?raw=true">
 </div>
  <br>
 
Currently, there is one readily available course **Data Science Fundamentals** that you can apply for. After pressing the **`Apply`** button, you'll see the next message followed by the **`Progress`** button:

<div align="center">
<img align="center" width="420" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/dsf-apply.png?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

Press the **`Progress`** button to prompt the **table of contents** to appear. **All unlocked modules** and your **progress** are displayed here.

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/progress.gif?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

We have several types of **activities**: 
* **`Materials`** 
* **`Test`** 
* **`Lab`**
* **`Project`**
* **`Kaggle`**

All activities except **`Materials`** are **graded** and have a set number of **attempts**, **maximum possible points**, and **deadlines**. If you use a few attempts, DRU-bot will **remember** your **best submission result**.  You can see all these indicators in the description of each activity in the bot.


## Materials

**`Materials`** button is a link to the table which contains a compilation of the best **MOOCs, articles, tutorials, books** and other resources on a given topic. Also, we specified all **software** you'll need to install and **accounts** you'll need to register to pass every single module. 

<div align="center">
<img align="center" width="625" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/materials.png?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

You can see, that there are 2 materials priorities: **Necessary 2 Pass Skills Test** and **Optional**. Materials with the first type are **required** for you to study. Also, it'll be great if you go through **optional** materials and check those that interest you.


Now let's move to graded activities.

## TEST

In order to pass the **`Test`** activity, follow the provided **link** and answer the questions.
After completing all the questions, press the **`Submit`** button and view the results of your submission.

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/math-test.gif?raw=true">
</div>
<br>


## Lab

To start working on the **`Lab`** activity, **download and unpack** the archive with the template of **Jupyter notebook**, where you will work on the tasks.

<div align="center">
<img align="center" width="653" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/lab-template.png?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

Upon finishing them, upload `.ipynb` file to your **Google Drive** and specify the following access rights:

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/access-rights.gif?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

Then copy the **link** to your file and follow the instructions to **submit** it using the **command** given by the bot. The bot will process your submission and provide the results. In case of **mistakes** in your code, the bot will also provide the **full traceback** to help you to fix errors.

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/lab-submission.gif?raw=true">
</div>
<br>


## Kaggle

First, you need to create an account on **Kaggle** if you don't have one. Read the instructions carefully and choose one competition from the list, complete it, and submit to Kaggle. 

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/kaggle-list.png?raw=true">
</div>
<br>

Then go to your Kaggle account settings and create an `API-token`. Copy it and use for submission to DRU-bot:

<div align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/DataRootUniversity/bot/blob/master/imgs/api-token.gif?raw=true">
</div> 
<br>

If you did everyting correct, the final result should look like this:

<div align="center">

</div>
<br>


## Project

**`Project`** activity will be available soon with all needed instructions for the submission.
