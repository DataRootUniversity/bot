- How to pass the First Module?
- How to use given materials?

### What Slack is and how to use it?
The link in invitation leads you to the platform called **Slack**.
**Slack** is the corporate messenger where you’ll take the course. Its features are similar to the most usual messengers you used before, so you’ll quickly get used to.

We highly recommend to download the desktop version of **Slack** because of its much more user-friendly interface than in the web-version.

##### Links for download:
**Windows**: https://slack.com/intl/en-ua/help/articles/209038037-Download-Slack-for-Windows   
**Mac**: https://slack.com/intl/en-ua/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac   
**Linux**: https://slack.com/intl/en-ua/help/articles/212924728-Download-Slack-for-Linux--beta-

After downloading you have to input the **workspace name**. 
Here is it: **dru-beta-v3.slack.com**

##### Use only the mail that received the invitation!!!
If you have any questions contact us: **@DRU Team**

Leftwards you could find the main channels for live communication, discussion of problems and converse with other students:

- **#chat** — the main chat for communication and discussion of the course
- **#introductions** — a place where you can tell about yourself and find people to study together
- **#memes** — the name of the channel speaks for itself. Share your or your favorite memes here!
- **#general** — a channel with messages from the bot about new students of the course and greetings to those who have already completed it
- **#dru-печеньки** — a new chat created for informal communication. Here you can read useful posts, share interesting materials, talk about any topic and also ask questions
- **#dsf_module_n** (where n = 1, ..., 7) — chats are created for questions related to the specific module

Most of the studying will take place in **@DRU Bot**. You could find it at the bottom of the chat list. 
*And so the fun begins…*

### How to start the course?
At the moment you got into Slack, you automatically applied to the “Data Science Fundamentals” course.
To check your task and modules go to the **@DRU Bot** App

![IMG 3 Bot overview](img/IMG_3_DRU_beta_v3.0_Slack.jpg)

Here you'll see simple Bot's interface and some course info:
- How many students on the course now
- Your total progress 
- Your Current Module
- Closest deadline
- And how many days to shift you have now

Also there are 2 buttons, that you’ll use all the time on course:
- "Shift deadline"
- "Invite friend"   

 
#### "Shift deadline" Button
This course is intensive and all modules have deadlines. And If you have not enough time to do your module, but want to continue studying you could shift the deadline a little.
Initially you’ll be given only 10 dru-shift days. So **use it wisely!!!** 

##### How to shift the deadline:
1. Click “Shift deadlines”
2. Choose the number of days you wanna shift
3. Then “Submit”

###### Here is demo use:

#### “Invite friend” Button
To make learning easier and more interesting you could invite your friend(s) to the course using unique referral code. For inviting this way you and your friend(s) will be rewarded some more shift days.  

##### How to invite friend:
1. Click “Invite friend”
2. Copy your referral code and link for the course page and send them to your friend
3. When registering, your friend have to paste your code into the special box below

###### Here is demo:

### How to pass the First Module?
From the moment of applying you’ll be given the Materials and the Math Test:

![IMG 4 Test](img/IMG_4_DRU_beta_v3.0_Slack.png)

Also you could see your deadlines here. 
By default, time for passing Module 1 is 7 days from the moment of applying. 
##### There are some things you should remember about course in whole:
- To unlock the next module you have to score **75%** of the current module maximum possible points;
- If you unlocked the next module before the deadline — the remaining days will be added to the next module;
- If you failed the deadline or spent all submission attempts but not opened the next module — contact us: **@DRU Team**

###### Here is demo:

![GIF 3 Test](img/GIF_3_Test.gif)


**Most students don’t pass the test on the first try, but it’s OK,** you have 10 attempts and many useful materials, which we will talk about now

---
### How to use given Materials?
**Materials** — an activity that isn’t evaluated and depends entirely on you. 
**You don’t need to study everything** — choose only those sections with which you have difficulties or which you want to improve.

There are two main types of materials: **Main** and **Additional**:
- **Main Materials** — include basic concepts and topics, the understanding of which is necessary.
- **Additional Materials** — include interesting articles on some topics, books and alternative video courses.

All resources are divided into math sections and activity types (MOOCs, articles, books, video). There is approximate time required to complete the activity at a normal speed to help you to plan your studying effectively.

***Hint:** you can open the Math Test (don't submit yet) and see which tasks you are not familiar with and what topics you need to study/recap. Note, that you haven't any time limits for passing the test, only limits on attempts.

**So, good luck!**
